    <h1>G64 Systems, LLC.</h1>
    
    <p>We are an AI infrastructure company that builds specialized models for law firms. Our solutions let law professionals drop documents into a folder, and the AI organizes them, processes them, and can instantly answer questions or summarize the documents. No technical skills or extra help is needed.</p>
    <p>Law firms sit on mountains of sensitive PDFs, emails, and filings. Finding, summarizing, and reusing that knowledge is slow and expensive. LLMs are the perfect tool for this because they excel at parsing long, unstructured text and reasoning across it to surface precedent, risk, and next steps in minutes.</p>
    <p>The problem: General-purpose LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) can’t be used here. They’re too generalized (unaware of firm-specific clause language, workflows, and risk tolerances, with higher hallucination rates on niche legal corpora) and they’re not private, since sending client data outside the firm’s enclave threatens privilege, ethics, and regulatory compliance. What works is a fine-tuned model that the firm fully owns and controls. But building an in-house AI team and infrastructure is expensive, slow, and complex.</p>
    <p>The answer: A private, fine-tuned LLM hosted fully inside the firm, trained on its own cases, clauses, templates, and outcomes. It connects to the firm’s document systems, uses strict access controls and encryption, and keeps detailed audit logs. This setup cuts review and drafting from days to minutes, preserves confidentiality, boosts accuracy through legal-specific tuning, keeps all IP in-house, and improves over time with attorney feedback.</p>
    <p>End-goal: Imagine you had a team of legal assistants that never sleeps, never forgets, and turns days of work into minutes–all while maintaining absolute client confidentiality and actually improving the more you use it. That’s what we’re selling to law firms. Each part of the system is like a team member. Some keep the system fast, some organize documents, some act as guards, and some help the staff ask questions or get work done faster. Everything happens inside the firm’s own private environment, keeping data safe and operations smooth.</p>

    <h2>Proof of concept</h2>
    <p><strong>Andrew Yang</strong><br>A partner at a prominent law firm told me AI is now doing work that used to be done by 1st to 3rd year associates.  AI can generate a motion in an hour that might take an associate a week. And the work is better. Someone should tell the folks applying to law school right now. He also said the models are getting noticeably better every few months too.</p>
    <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong><br>With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 (LLM) is better than PHD level in every subject, no exceptions.</p>
    <p><strong>McKinsey & Company</strong><br>Top performers are attributing over 10% of their earnings to generative AI implementations.</p>
