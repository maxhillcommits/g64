    <h1>G64 Systems LLC</h1>

    <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> We build private AI systems for law firms and guarantee a return on investment within 6 months or your money back.</p>
    <p>We are an LLM infrastructure company that builds and deploys specialized systems for law firms. By reducing non-billable busywork to near zero, these systems enable law firms to add hundreds of billable hours per month without longer workdays or increased headcount.</p>
    <p>Law firms sit on mountains of sensitive documents, emails, and filings. Finding, summarizing, and reusing that knowledge is slow and expensive.</p>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) solve this problem extremely well. LLMs for legal work are what industrial machines were for manufacturing: turning slow, manual labor into fast, scalable output. LLMs are the perfect tool for legal work because they excel at parsing long, unstructured text and reasoning across it to surface precedent, risk, and next steps in minutes.</p>
    <p>Imagine you had a team of legal assistants that never slept, never forgot, and turned days of grunt work into minutes–all while maintaining absolute client confidentiality and actually improving the more you use it. <u>That’s what we’re selling to law firms</u>.</p>

    <h2>Fast ROI</h2>
    <p>Our service is 100% risk-free. If your firm doesn't see a return on investment in less than 6 months, you get your money back.</p>
