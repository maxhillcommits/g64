    <h1>G64 Systems, LLC.</h1>
    
    <p>We are an LLM development company that builds specialized models for law firms. These models allow law firms to save a ton time, bill more hours, reduce non-billable hours, and get much more done without increasing headcount.</p>
    <p>Law firms sit on mountains of sensitive PDFs, emails, and filings. Finding, summarizing, and reusing that knowledge is slow and expensive. There has been no way around this problem… until now.</p>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) solve this problem extremely well. LLMs for legal work are what industrial machines were for manufacturing: turning slow, manual labor into fast, scalable output. LLMs are the perfect tool for legal work because they excel at parsing long, unstructured text and reasoning across it to surface precedent, risk, and next steps in minutes.</p>
    <p>We build and train models specifically tailored for your firm. Imagine you had a team of legal assistants that never sleeps, never forgets, and turns days of work into minutes–all while maintaining absolute client confidentiality and actually improving the more you use it. That’s what we’re selling to law firms.
</p>

    <h2>Work with us</h2>
    
    <p>If you're interested in working with us, please fill out our application and we'll get back to you. Please note we only work with one client at a time.</p>

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>End-to-end product workflow.<li>
    <li>Why LLMs are perfect for legal work.</li>

    <h2>Proof of concept</h2>
    <p><strong>Andrew Yang</strong><br>A partner at a prominent law firm told me AI is now doing work that used to be done by 1st to 3rd year associates.  AI can generate a motion in an hour that might take an associate a week. And the work is better. Someone should tell the folks applying to law school right now. He also said the models are getting noticeably better every few months too.</p>
    <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong><br>With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 (LLM) is better than PHD level in every subject, no exceptions.</p>
    <p><strong>McKinsey & Company</strong><br>Top performers are attributing over 10% of their earnings to generative AI implementations.</p>
